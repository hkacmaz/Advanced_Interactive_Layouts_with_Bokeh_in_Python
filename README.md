# Advanced_Layouts_with_Bokeh_in_python
Bokeh is an interactive data visualization library for Python (and other languages such as "rbokeh" for R). The goal of this repo is to give you a quick idea what is it, and how to use it to have advanced layouts.

Bokeh targets modern web browsers for presentation. It can create versatile, data-driven graphics, and connect the full power of the entire Python data-science stack to rich, interactive visualizations.
